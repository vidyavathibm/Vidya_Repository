1)Write a program which will find all such numbers which are divisible by 7 but are not a multiple of 5,
between 2000 and 3200 (both included).
The numbers obtained should be printed in a comma-separated sequence on a single line.

list1=[]
for i in range(2000,3200):
  if i%7==0 and i%5!=0:
      list1.append(str(i))
print(','.join(list1))



2)square root of a number without using built in or **

num=25
sq=num/2
temp=0
while sq!=temp:
  temp=sq
  sq=(num/temp+temp)/2
print(sq)
